# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 13, 2020, Wednesday


**Today's Progress**: Completed the Python development tutorial(Uptill 0:45:36) from freecodecamp.org under Learn Python by Building Five Games - Full Course(YouTube)

**Thoughts:** After too many ups and downs, finally the second semester comes to an end(apart from vivas). With a commitment to do something productive, here I am beginning with Python development. This game development tutorial is helping me understand functions of various modules from scratch. I also pushed the tutorial code to GitHub which helped me understand git.
