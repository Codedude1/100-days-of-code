# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 13, 2020, Wednesday


**Today's Progress**: Completed the Python development tutorial(Uptill 0:45:36) from freecodecamp.org under Learn Python by Building Five Games - Full Course(YouTube)

**Thoughts:** After too many ups and downs, finally the second semester comes to an end(apart from vivas). With a commitment to do something productive, here I am beginning with Python development. This game development tutorial is helping me understand functions of various modules from scratch. I also pushed the tutorial code to GitHub which helped me understand git.

### Day 1: May 14, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Tried to continue the above mentioned tutorial(Uptill 1:11:21) from freecodecamp.org under Learn Python by Building Five Games - Full Course(YouTube)

**Thoughts:** Well, I was pretty excited in the beginning, when the instructor said that he will be introducing Classes and Objects for the next project:The iconic Snake game . Eventually, I found it too challenging to understand at once. So, here I'm taking a pause and will try to continue tommorrow morning. As of now, only 20% progress is made. To be continued.
